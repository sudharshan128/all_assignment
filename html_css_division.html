        <p style="color:white;">AI stands for artificial intelligence, which is the ability of a computer or a robot to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. AI can learn from data, reason, discover meaning, generalize, and adapt to new situations. AI can also perceive its surroundings through sensors, such as cameras or microphones, and interact with humans or other machines through speech or text. AI has many applications in various fields, such as medicine, education, entertainment, business, and security. Some examples of AI are web search engines, recommendation systems, voice assistants, self-driving cars, and chess programs. AI can also create new content, such as art, music, or stories. AI is a rapidly developing field that aims to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI), which is the ability to solve any problem that a human can. However, AI also poses some challenges and risks, such as ethical issues, social impacts, and potential threats to human values and safety. Therefore, AI research and development need to be guided by principles and regulations that ensure its beneficial and responsible use for humanity.</p>
